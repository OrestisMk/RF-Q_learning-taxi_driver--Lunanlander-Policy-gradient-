Within this folder, it is possible to find the report, code and individual contribution files.

The code for the basic implementation (Taxi) and the advanced implementation (Landing) is inside the "code" folder. In order to avoid uploading the libraries as the size of the folder would have exceeded the maximum size of 200MB, it has been added a "requirements.txt" file in each implementation's folder (Taxi & Landing). This way, it is possible to create a virtual environment and execute "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all the dependencies.

Finally, in order to recreate the obtained results for both implementations, the "main.py" file inside each implementation's folder should be executed.
