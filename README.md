# RF-Q_learning-taxi_driver--Lunanlander-Policy-gradient-
This is a project of reinforcement learning which contains two different enviroments. The first enviroment is the taxi driver problem in 4x4 space with the simple Q-learning update rule. In this task, we compared the performance of e-greedy policy and boltzmann policy. 
As second enviroment , we chose the LunarLander from openAi gym. For the implementation of the project, the Policy gradient has been selected.

The project was carried out by Orestis Makris and Victor Ceballos-Espinosa.
