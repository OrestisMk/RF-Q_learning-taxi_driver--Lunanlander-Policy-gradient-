# RF-Q_learning-taxi_driver--Lunanlander-Policy-gradient-
This is a project of reinforcement learning which contains two different environments. The first environment is the taxi driver problem in 4x4 space with the simple Q-learning update rule. In this task, we compared the performance of the e-greedy policy and Boltzmann policy. As a second environment, we chose the LunarLander from the open gym. For the implementation of the project, the Policy gradient has been selected.

The project was carried out by Orestis Makris and Victor Ceballos-Espinosa.
